Description
----------------------------------------------------------
gameState altered in unexpected ways when current player has no treasure in deck or discard

Steps
----------------------------------------------------------
Run the cardEffectAdventurer function on a gameState where the current player does not have any copper, silver, or gold in either their discard or deck piles.

Expected Results
----------------------------------------------------------
Unclear what the intended behavior here should be. My assumption is that the player should simply discard the played adventurer card and not gain any additional cards. In this case, handCount should decrease by 1 and discardCount should increase by 1.

Actual Results
----------------------------------------------------------
Current player’s handCount was set to an invalid/incorrect value (-34 was one such observed value).
